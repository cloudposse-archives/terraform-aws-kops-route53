# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to lookup an IAM role associated with `kops` masters, and attach an IAM policy to the role with permissions to modify Route53 record sets.

  It provides the IAM permissions needed by [route53-kubernetes](https://github.com/cloudposse/route53-kubernetes) for `kops`.

  This is useful to make Kubernetes services discoverable via AWS DNS services.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```hcl
  module "kops_route53" {
    source       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-route53.git?ref=master"
    namespace    = "cp"
    stage        = "prod"
    name         = "route53"
    masters_name = "masters"

    tags = {
      Cluster = "k8s.domain.com"
    }
  }
  ```
